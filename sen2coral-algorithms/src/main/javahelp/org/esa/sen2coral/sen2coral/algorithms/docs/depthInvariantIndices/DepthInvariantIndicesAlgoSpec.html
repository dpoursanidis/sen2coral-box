<h3>Depth Invariant Indices</h3>

<p>
    The calculation of depth invariant indices is a water column correction step
    that is frequently a useful pre-processing step for benthic classification. The presentation here
    follows Lyzenga (1978) and Green et al. (2000). The basic ideal is that attenuation of the reflectance
    is approximately inverse exponential with water depth, therefore the transform,
</p>
<IMG SRC="../images/depthInvariantIndices/equation.jpg">

<p>
    approximately linearises the effect of depth on reflectance. Ri is the pixel reflectance in band i, and
    Ri-deep, is the deep water reflectance in that band. A plot of the pixel values of two such transformed
    bands over a benthic type with constant reflectance but at different depths will lie on a line (following figure)
</p>

<p>
    The slope of these lines is the same and is dependent on the optical properties of the water, but the
    vertical position (i.e. the x or y-intercept) of the lines is not, and is a function of the bottom
    reflectance. In mathematical terms for bands i and j,
</p>
<IMG SRC="../images/depthInvariantIndices/equation1.jpg">

<p>
    The constant term dij determines the intercept and is the depth invariant index we seek to compute.
    It is therefore necessary to know the ratio of the water attenuation coefficients in the two bands
    ki/kj, however it is not necessary to know the individual attenuation coefficients. The ratio can be
    calculated from the image by taking a sample of pixels of consistent bottom type over a range of
    depths and performing a least squares regression of the above equation. The procedure is therefore
    entirely image based, and knowledge of the bottom reflectances, water optical properties or depths
    are not required. A weakness however is that it is assumed that water optical properties are
    consistent across the site at least such that the ratio of the attenuation coefficients ki and kj are
    consistent.

<p>
    The step by step process to produce one depth-invariant index layer is:
<ul>
    <li>Select two bands to use to make the depth invariant index, the bands should have water
        penetration as far as the features of interest so with respect to Sentinel 2 MSI this means
        bands 1 to 5, although bands 1 to 3 are in the most useful wavelength range.</li>
    <li>Select an ROI over a deep water region. From this ROI the deep water reflectance, Ri
        deep, is calculated for both bands.</li>
    <li>Select a set of ROIs over the same bottom type but at different depths. Areas of submerged
        sand are a good choice since they are easily identifiable, relatively homogenous and being
        bright provide a good signal to noise ratio.</li>
    <li>The ratio of attenuation coefficients is calculated using least squares regression with
        perpendicular offsets. The method of perpendicular offsets (Weisstein 2016) is used because
        there is no concept of dependent and independent variable, and the calculated ratio should
        be the effectively the same regardless of which way around the bands are chosen (i.e. the
        reciprocal if bands are swapped). From Green et al. (2000) the calculation is:
        <br/><IMG SRC="../images/depthInvariantIndices/equation2.jpg">
        <br/>where,
        <br/><IMG SRC="../images/depthInvariantIndices/equation3.jpg">
        <br/>and the covariance is calculated as usual,
        <br/><IMG SRC="../images/depthInvariantIndices/equation4.jpg">
        <br/>where the Xi values from which the means are taken are over the sample of homogenous
        bottom pixels.
    </li>
    <li>Finally the depth invariant index is calculated in every pixel (except any that are masked due
        to cloud, land, etc.) and the output layer created according to the formula:

    </li>

</ul>

    An example generation of a depth invariant index layer from bands 2 and 3 of a Sentinel 2 image is
    shown below.
