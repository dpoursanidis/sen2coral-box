<h3>Deglint</h3>

<p>
    The purpose of the glint correction or "deglint" is to remove the contribution of the direct reflectance
    from the top of the air-water interface from the imagery. Such photons have never penetrated the
    water surface and do not carry spectral information about subsurface features. Dependent on
    conditions and pixel size glint can manifest as sheen on the surface or as bright lines co-incident with
    waves.

<p>
    The deglint algorithm described here is based on Hedley at al. (2005) and other very similar methods
    described in Kay et al. (2008). The algorithm is entirely image-based, bands in visible wavelengths
    are corrected one at a time by reference to another band which is in the NIR (near infra-red) or SWIR
    (short wave infra-red). It is assumed that the NIR reference band only contains the glint (because
    water is opaque in the NIR) and so the contribution of the glint in the visible band can be estimated
    by the brightness in the NIR band, by a simple linear relationship. To establish the relationship a
    linear regression between the two bands is performed over a deep water area, where the
    contribution from below the water surface is assumed homogenous, and so the derived relationship
    is only based on the surface reflectance. It is required to specify the minimum expected NIR value in
    the absence of glint, denoted MinNIR. This can be taken as the minimum value over the sample area
    (default) or physically set as a number (optional).
