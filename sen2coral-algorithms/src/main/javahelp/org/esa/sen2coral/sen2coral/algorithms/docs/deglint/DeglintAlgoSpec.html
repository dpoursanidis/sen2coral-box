<h3>Deglint</h3>

<p>
    The purpose of the glint correction or "deglint" is to remove the contribution of the direct reflectance
    from the top of the air-water interface from the imagery. Such photons have never penetrated the
    water surface and do not carry spectral information about subsurface features. Dependent on
    conditions and pixel size glint can manifest as sheen on the surface or as bright lines co-incident with
    waves.
</p>

<IMG SRC="../images/deglint/deglintExample.jpg" ALT="Example deglint applied to bands 2, 3 and 4 of Sentinel 2 scene over
a reef in northern Palau. Band 8 was used as the glint reference band.">

<p>
    The deglint algorithm described here is based on Hedley at al. (2005) and other very similar methods
    described in Kay et al. (2008). The algorithm is entirely image-based, bands in visible wavelengths
    are corrected one at a time by reference to another band which is in the NIR (near infra-red) or SWIR
    (short wave infra-red). It is assumed that the NIR reference band only contains the glint (because
    water is opaque in the NIR) and so the contribution of the glint in the visible band can be estimated
    by the brightness in the NIR band, by a simple linear relationship. To establish the relationship a
    linear regression between the two bands is performed over a deep water area, where the
    contribution from below the water surface is assumed homogenous, and so the derived relationship
    is only based on the surface reflectance. It is required to specify the minimum expected NIR value in
    the absence of glint, denoted MinNIR. This can be taken as the minimum value over the sample area
    (default) or physically set as a number (optional).

<p>
    A step by step outline of the procedure is:
<ul>
    <li>Select a sample area (or areas) of the image displaying a range of sun glint, but where the
        image would be expected to be more or less homogeneous if the sun glint was not present
        (e.g. over deep water).</li>
    <li>Select which band(s) to correct and the NIR band to be used as the glint reference</li>
    <li>For each band to have sun glint removed, perform a linear regression of NIR brightness
        (x-axis) against the band signal (y-axis) using the selected pixels. The slope of the regression
        line is the output of interest, for band i, call it bi.</li>
    <li>Determine MinNIR , the minimum in the NIR band over the sample area, or, input a value to
        use for MinNIR.</li>
    <li>To deglint band i for all pixels in the image, subtract the product of bi and the NIR brightness
        of the pixel (minus MinNIR ) from the pixel value in band i according to the equation:</li>
    <IMG SRC="../images/deglint/equation.jpg">
</ul>
</p>

<p>
    An important point, of specific relevance to Sentinel 2, is that the band to be corrected and the NIR
    reference must be of the same spatial resolution, and have close spatial and temporal alignment.
    The algorithm assumes that each pixel images exactly the same water surface feature in the two
    bands, if the bands are not in exact spatial alignment, the regression will be poor and correction will
    not work well. Similarly if due to integration time requirements the bands are not imaged
    coincidentally since the sea surface is in motion the correction may not work well. While these issues
    could be investigated from a theoretical analysis of the instrument design, trial and error is the most
    practical method for achieving optimal results.
</p>

<p>
    The following table lists the Sentinel 2 MSI bands and indicates which bands can be used as NIR references for
    correction of bands 1 to 5. Bands from 6 onwards (773 nm) are not corrected because they are not
    useful for subsurface mapping as these wavelengths do not penetrate into the water.

<h4>Deglint implementation in SNAP</h4>
<p>
    The deglint algorithm has been implemented into SNAP with the following features:
    <ul>
        <li>Generation of multi-band products.</li>
        <li>Support for multi-size input bands.</li>
        <li>Possibility to mask negative reflectance values.</li>
        <li>Highly configurable</li>
    </ul>
