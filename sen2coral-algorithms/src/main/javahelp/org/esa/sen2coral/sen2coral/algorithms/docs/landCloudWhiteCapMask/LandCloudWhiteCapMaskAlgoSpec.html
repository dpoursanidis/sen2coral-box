<h3>Land, cloud and white cap mask</h3>


<p>
    There are three simple processes that can be used to generate a mask layer within Sen2Coral
    project:
<ul>
    <li>Masking pixels where the value in a NIR band is above a user-set threshold.</li>
    <li>The deglint algorithm typically produces negative values over land, clouds and white caps.</li>
    <li>Manually drawing ROIs over areas to be excluded.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
    The first two steps work because the near infrared wavelengths do not penetrate into the water, so
    after deglint is applied clear areas of water appear very dark. Clouds, white caps and land typically
    have high reflectance in the NIR (Figure below). The third process, manual delineation, is frequently
    required particularly for cloud shadow. Such areas appear darker than the surrounding area and
    over reefs they can appear as dark benthic patches even under visual interpretation. Sometimes the
    only clue that a shadow is present that a cloud of the same shape and relative location can be seen.
    Masking such features cannot be effectively automated so manual delineation remains required in
    some circumstances.

<h4>Land, cloud and white cap mask - implementation in SNAP</h4>
<p>
    The Land, cloud and white cap mask algorithm has been implemented into SNAP with the following features:
<ul>
    <li>Generation of multi-band products.</li>
    <li>Support for multi-size input bands.</li>
    <li>Possibility to mask negative reflectance values.</li>
    <li>Highly configurable.</li>
</ul>
