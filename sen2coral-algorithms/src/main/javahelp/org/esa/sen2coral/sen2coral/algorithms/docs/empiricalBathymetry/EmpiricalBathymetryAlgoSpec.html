<h3>Empirical Bathymetry</h3>

<p>
    Estimation of bathymetry by empirical regression methods is a commonly applied shallow water
    mapping technique. Where some in-situ bathymetric data is available, for example from a boat
    sonar system (most of which are automatically log to GPS now), and with a good quality image, a
    simple regression method can be used to calibrate a bathymetry retrieval algorithm.
</p>

<p>
    A variety of empirical bathymetry methods have been published, they all rely on the assumption of
    exponential attenuation of light with depth and are similar to the depth invariant index method
    described previously. The method implemented follows that of Stumpf et al. (2003) which
    relies on the ratio of the log-transform of two bands. I.e. the depth, z, is
</p>

<p>
    where n is a user-set constant which should be chosen to ensure the logarithms are positive and the
    relationship is maximally linear. The Rw terms are the atmospherically corrected reflectances in two
    bands i and j. The constants m1 and m0 are estimated by linear regression over the in-situ sample
    points.
</p>

<p>
    A step by step procedure, given an atmospherically corrected image, is:
<ul>
    <li>Choose which two bands to use. For Sentinel 2 these will most frequently be Band 2 and 3
        but other options should be available.</li>
    <li>Import a set of bathymetry point data (latitude, longitude, depth) and extract the pixel
        values of the two bands at those points.</li>
    <li>Choose a value for n, or a default value can be set based on the criteria that the logarithm of
        n multiplied by any pixel value to be processed should be non-negative.</li>
    <li>Perform a least-squares regression to estimate m1 and m0, report r-squared.</li>
    <li>Possibly choose another value for n, based on maximising the r-squared value, and repeat
        the above step.</li>
    <li>Process all non-masked pixels to create depth layer based on m1 and m0 and the above
        equation.</li>
</ul>
